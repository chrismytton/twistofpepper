## Introduction

I've had the domain name for this project for a while now, I purchased it with another
project in mind, times change, my plans change, and now I have repurposed the domain name
for a new experiment.

## Description

The server initially serves up a static html page, the application is all 
written in javascript, on the client side, sammy is used for the client side logic,
node is used on the server, after loading the page, the communication happens over websockets,
thanks to socket.io.
